User experience (UX) refers to the overall experience of a person using a product, system, or service. It encompasses the practical, experiential, affective, meaningful, and valuable aspects of human-computer interaction and product ownership. Essentially, it's about how a person feels when interfacing with a product or service. <br/> <br/>  

For example, most of you have used the traditional TV remote. Yes, that TV, which was the source of entertainment for you all when you were not busy on Netflix. Tell me honestly how many buttons you have pressed for a purpose in the TV remote. I know most of your answers would be less than half of the buttons. Now let's come to today's scenario. I know most of you have seen and even used fire stick remote. Let's ask the same question again, Tell me honestly how many buttons you have pressed for a purpose in a firestick remote. your answers would be most of that and even all of that. So what's the difference between both cases, yes you are right, that is UX . and thatâ€™s one of the major reasons for the growing popularity of the amazon fire stick. <br/> <br/>

Good user experience is important because it can help to increase customer satisfaction and loyalty, leading to increased business success. When designing a product or service, it's important to consider the user experience at every stage of the design process, from the initial concept to the final product. This includes things like the usability of the product, the aesthetic appeal of its design, and the overall enjoyment that a person gets from using it. UX should be seamless and easy so that customers would come again and again for the product or service. <br/> <br/>

Many different factors can influence the user experience,
including the user's goals and needs, the design and functionality of the
product, and the context in which it is used. User experience design is a
the multidisciplinary field that involves psychology, computer science,
engineering, and design. <br/> <br/>

Quality of the product or service will decide the fate of your business but UX will decide the destiny of your business. few companies have an edge over other companies not on the basis of the service or products but because of user experience. Amazon is doing better than other competitors not because it has large number of suppliers or a huge product range but it is doing good because of the UX amazon gives on its website. <br/> <br/>

If you give convenience to customers in the form of UX, customers will come again and again to use your product and services. you can improve UX by changing market strategy also. For example, Most of you have noticed that the counter person of Starbucks doesn't write names on the paper cup correctly instead of telling them again and again, which results in a different kind of UX for customers, which also gives the counter person more time to chat with the customer and suggest him other snacks. <br/> <br/>

UX is research based not opinion based. For example when the chai sutta bar started, On the menu, they listed N number of things on the opinion of their friends and colleague.. but soon they realized that people are getting confused by seeing lots of items on the menu list and buys nothing .. and also it's difficult for them to keep all the things in stock. So they decided to reduce the list to a few products by researching about the taste of people which ended up in a modified list that has less than 15 items . Which results in an increase in sales and footfall in their outlets. <br/> <br/>

By changing the perspective of people can also result in achieving the desired user experience like what Steve jobs did. In the launch of Apple nano music player Steve job have asked the question to the audience that, what is the role of a small pocket available just above the primary pocket of jeans. Most of them thought that it would be for keeping coins or something but Steve jobs changed the perspective of the audience by telling it that it is used to keep 1000 songs. <br/> <br/>
